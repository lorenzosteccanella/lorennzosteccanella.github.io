## Welcome

I am a Ph.D. student in the area of Reinforcement Learning at [UPF](https://www.upf.edu/). My main interests are in the area of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Robotics with the focus on developing lifelong learning systems.

I am actually based in Barcelona where I recently joined the [Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning group at UPF](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml) for doing my Ph.D.

Before moving to Barcelona I have been working in two laboratories:

- [Blue Brain Project EPFL](https://bluebrain.epfl.ch/) with the goal to develop Deep Neural Network for generative vision problems.

- [University of Verona Intcatch Project](http://intcatch.eu/), to develop Deep Learning systems for vision and Multi-agent planning frameworks.
